# Comparing Teenage Birth Rates between Baltimore, MD and Morris County, NJ by Race 

Baltimore City, MD is a metropolitan area in Maryland. While some neighborhoods are primarily wealthy, others struggle economically. This affects many aspects of the city's residents' lives, including their access to education, housing and food security, and more.

In contrast, Morris County, NJ is a suburban area mostly comprised of people who have reached relatively high socioeconomic statuses. It has been named one of New Jersey's most affluent counties regularly. 

I thought it would be interesting to compare an aspect of the residents' lives between Baltimore and Morris County. Since I enjoy learning about maternal and child health, I decided to analyze teenage birth rates in these two locations. I also wanted to consider if race plays a role in the rates. 

This led to the business question: How do the teenage birth rates between Baltimore City, MD and Morris County, NJ compare and how does race affect the results? 

I downloaded data from https://www.opportunityatlas.org/ to conduct my analysis â€“ 8 workbooks, each specific for the 4 races in the 2 locations.

These charts represent the teenage birth rates for each tract by race for each of the two locations analyzed. Upon first glance of the charts, Baltimore City, MD seems to have higher teenage birth rates than Morris County, NJ. It seems like most of the tracts in Baltimore City are congregated at a level of 0.4 to 0.6, whereas most of the tracts in Morris County are congregated between levels of 0.1 to 0.4. When we break it down by race, it seems like both places have the highest rates among black people. Of the rates for black people, there seem to be some tracts that are visibly higher than others. I wanted to see which tracts had especially high rates, and after that analysis, I found that 38.68% of the tracts in Baltimore have rates higher than the average rate for the black race, and 21.01% for Morris County. 						

Based on this analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that the teenage birth rates are generally higher for Baltimore City, MD than Morris County, NJ, and the black race seems to hold the highest rates for both of the locations. The analysis on which tracts have the highest tracts can be built upon by identifying the quality of the sex ed system, accessibility of convenience stores that sell birth control, and similar factors for those tracts.
